# /release-retro

Generate a release retrospective report showing what happened during the release.

## When to Run

Run this **Tuesday morning** after production has been stable.

## Input

Arguments: {{#if $ARGUMENTS}}$ARGUMENTS{{else}}(none){{/if}}

## Argument Parsing

| Pattern | Days Lookback |
|---------|---------------|
| Empty | 30 |
| Number (e.g., `60`) | N |

## Execution

```bash
node {baseDir}/dist/releases/cli.js --action retro --days <DAYS>
```

## What It Shows

- **Timeline**: Staging date, prod date
- **Outcome**: Clean release or hotfixes required, with counts by type
- **What Shipped**: PRs, contributors, lines changed, top contributors
- **Staging Hotfixes**: PRs merged to staging during QA (not part of release train)
- **Release Hotfixes**: PRs merged directly to release (prod hotfixes)
- **Trend**: Last 4 releases with staging/release hotfix breakdown
- **Action Items**: Outstanding backmerge reminders

## Error Handling

- If no release train found: inform user to run after develop → staging is merged
- If promotion pending: show partial report
- If `gh` not authenticated: suggest running `gh auth login`

## Output Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Display the script output VERBATIM to the user. Do NOT summarize, paraphrase, or reformat the output. The report contains markdown tables and formatting that should be shown exactly as produced. Simply run the command and show the complete raw output.
